    <h3>Macdonald's Apple Pie</h3>
    <p>Make McDonald's apple pies right at home with this copycat recipe. Better than anything you can get from the drive-thru!</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups peeled, chopped (1/2-inch) apples (from 2 small [12 ounces total] mixed variety apples)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 medium lemon) </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir together apples and lemon juice. Sprinkle with brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a medium bowl; set aside until apples release some juice, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high until melted and bubbling. Add apple mixture and reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are softened and juices are just slightly reduced, 6 to 9 minutes. Stir in cornstarch and vanilla; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is bubbling and thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and let stand until slightly cooled, 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll out one refrigerated pie crust into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Cut into 8 (4x2-inch) rectangles, discarding scraps or reserving for another use. Cover cut dough with plastic wrap and repeat with remaining pie crust. Place 8 dough rectangles on a work surface, and lightly brush with egg all the way to edges. </li>
    </ol>
